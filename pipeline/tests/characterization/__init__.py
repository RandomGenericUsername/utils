"""Characterization tests for task-pipeline current behavior.

These tests document the current behavior of the system, even when correctness
is unknown or the behavior may change in the future.

Characterization tests focus on:
- Documenting current behavior as-is
- Freezing behavior for future comparison
- Identifying unimplemented features
- Edge cases with unclear intent

All characterization tests should:
- Start with "test_characterization__" prefix
- Include a docstring explaining what behavior is being frozen
- Include a TODO if the behavior should change
