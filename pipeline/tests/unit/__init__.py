"""Unit tests for task-pipeline isolated components.

These tests verify individual components in isolation with dependencies mocked.
Unit tests focus on:
- Pure logic testing
- Edge cases
- Error conditions
- Isolated component behavior

Unit tests should:
- Mock all external dependencies
- Test one component at a time
- Be fast and deterministic
- Not test integration between components
