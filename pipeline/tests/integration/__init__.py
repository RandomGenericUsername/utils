"""Integration tests for task-pipeline end-to-end workflows.

These tests verify that complete workflows function correctly from start to finish.
Integration tests focus on:
- End-to-end execution flows
- Component interactions
- Data flow through the system
- Real-world usage scenarios

Integration tests should NOT test:
- Individual unit logic in isolation
- API contract stability (use contract tests)
- Current behavior documentation (use characterization tests)
