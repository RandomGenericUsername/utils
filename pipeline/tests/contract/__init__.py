"""Contract tests for task-pipeline public API.

These tests verify that the public API contracts remain stable and do not break.
Contract tests focus on:
- Method signatures
- Type contracts
- Required vs optional parameters
- Return types
- Exception contracts
- Public API guarantees

Contract tests should NOT test:
- Internal implementation details
- Performance characteristics
- Specific business logic
